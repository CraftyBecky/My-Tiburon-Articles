This is my practice for HTML, CSS and JavScript. My goal in this is to practice everything that I have learned, along with some
additional things along the way. 

I have written so far, four blogs/articles for the USS Tiburon website and newsletter. I have decided to combine all of them into one. Here I will be keeping track of my plans and what I have accomplished when. This is my documentation and everything will be put into a repository on GitHub. 

The multuple HTML files allow me the opportunity practice HTML more.

1. Main title for full site - Completed 12/26/21
    Becky's Tiburon Articles

2. Home Page - 
    Contains a main article about this collection of pages - Completed 12/29/21
    Add a JavaScript alert that says "Welcome to my site" - possible change alert name
    Add a form for options on favorite blog and why
    
3. All pages will contain:
    A large photo header - either in the background header or a small image for each page
    A medium footer containing links to:
    - LinkedIn - Added 12/31/21 icon - need to make link work
    - GitHub - Added icon - need to make link work
    - Email added - Added 12/31/21 icon - need to make link work
    - WebFlow Wedding Page - still in the works - need wedding date and location
    - USS Tiburon Website 

    A top navigation bar linking to:
    - articles
    - About Me - Turned into main page
    - sizes down to a hamburger/accordian with different page breaks
    - Search bar that takes you to the articles with those keywords - will require more work/SEO

4. Build 5 seperate HTML files ~ Now 4 with a possible 5th for more things I have learned or made
    - Home - Why I made this page and what to expect - Completed 12/29/21
    - Different Methods for Ongoing Learning - Completed 12/27/21
    - Nutrition and Mental Fitness - Completed 12/27/21
    - Common Nutrional Dificencies - Completed 12/27/21
    - Physical Health Struggles and How to Combat Them - Completed 12/27/21
    - About Me - Added to main page

5. Make a repository to GitHub so that progress can be updated regularly

6. Also spend time working on WebFlow Wedding Website

7. Possibly go in and add little components like a weather app, maybe little gif's throughout the site, maybe things that I 
learn along the way. Eventually combine all HTML files into one and link appropriately.
