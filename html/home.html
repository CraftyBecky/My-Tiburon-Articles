        <p>Welcome to my current/starter project. This was built as a way to combine all of the articles that I have written to date for the USS Tiburon, which is Denver's Local Fan Group. I am the Chief Medical Officer,
            so my articles are geared toward being healthly in all manners. The articles written here focus on health, both physical and mental, along with how important it is to continue to learn. This last article stemed from my change in career 
            path. As a current medical biller in a home infusion company, it became a realization when talking with a close friend of mine who is a senior web developer, that I have my skills are
            going to waste and I have run stagenent in my current place of work. With billing as repetative as it is, it just feels like I am not going anywhere.</p>
        <p>So here I am learning to code, expand my brain and make some really cool stuff along the way. I really enjoy seeing what I have made, even the small amount. 
            I have added a fun little form on another page, so that you can let me know which ones you enjoyed the most. There are a large number of links to information I have found
            when writing these. I have many interests and love finding more things that interest me. Coding and web development 
            being a perfect example. This was something that I never thought that I would be able to do, having not gone to college for it but instead was a Geology/Enviornmental Science major. Though I have always had an interest in
            learning it.</p>
